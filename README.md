 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

Framework:
Game idea:
Implementing from apple pciker- tree moving left and right-Is target
Implementing from mission demolition  The slingshot- along with scripts
player shoots for the target

Using the scripts from previous prototype I will create a game with
some of the mechanics used for apple picker, roll a ball and mission demolition.

Game Concept: 
Shoot to hit the target. Obsticles will destroy projectiles 
and subtract points. Hitting Obsticle will subtract 50 points. While hitting 
target will gain 100 points
